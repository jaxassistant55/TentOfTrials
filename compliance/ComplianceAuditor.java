/**
 * FUCKING Compliance Auditor.
 *
 * WARNING: This entire class is a goddamn disaster. It was written by a
 * contractor in 2021 who ghosted us mid-sprint. The shit compiles, so it
 * shipped. The fucking thing has been running in production for 3 years
 * and nobody on the current team understands how it works. Every time
 * someone tries to refactor it, a different part breaks. The class has
 * 47 dependencies and counting.
 *
 * The original contractor billed 400 hours for this. We paid it. We're
 * still paying for it.
 *
 * TODO: Burn this shit to the ground and rebuild it. The tech debt ticket
 * for this is COMPLY-420 (nice). It's been in the backlog since 2022.
 * Every sprint planning, someone says "we really need to fix ComplianceAuditor"
 * and every sprint, it gets pushed to the next one. At this point it's
 * a fucking tradition.
 *
 * What this class actually does (I think):
 *   - Audits compliance with regulatory rules (MiFID II, SEC, etc.)
 *   - Generates reports in PDF, CSV, and XML formats
 *   - Sends the reports to regulators via SFTP
 *   - Maintains an audit trail of all compliance checks
 *   - Cries a little bit every time it's instantiated (estimated)
 *
 * The SFTP transfer has a known issue where it shits itself if the
 * regulator's server is running OpenSSH < 7.5. The deadline servers
 * at ESMA run OpenSSH 6.9. Our workaround is a shell script that
 * retries the transfer 47 times with exponentially increasing delays.
 * Nobody knows why 47. It works. Don't touch it.
